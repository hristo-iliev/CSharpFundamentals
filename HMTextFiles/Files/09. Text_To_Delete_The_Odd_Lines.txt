1	Q: What is porn? What are examples? Is it bad?
2	
3	A: Porn is basically people having sex.. on camera.
4	and its really really inappropriate. Is it bad? Yea I think so.
5	I mean looking at it from a worldly perspective, its bad
6	(specially if your under 20 or even 30 for that matter)
7	but looking at it from a Christian perspective, its horrible. 
8	And honestly, its like drugs. if you never start it, you never have to stop it. 
9	My best advice is to stay far far away from it.
10	Well do you watch Bad Girls Club? that show is rated G compared to Porn... so yea.
11	I've never ever seen it but I know enough to know, Christian or not, you should stay away.

13	A: Well my mom told my brother and me if we looked at porn
14	that it should not contain violence or anything out of the ordinary
15	of course this doesn't affect me because I don't like porn nor have I ever seen it.
