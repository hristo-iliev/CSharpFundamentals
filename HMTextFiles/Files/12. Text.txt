Michael Schumacher (born 3 January 1969) is a retired German racing driver.
Schumacher is a seven-time Formula One (F1) World Champion and is widely regarded
as one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time. He holds many of Formula One's driver
records, including most championships, race victories, fastest laps, pole positions
and most races won in a single season – 13 in 2004. In 2002 he became the only driver
in Formula One history to finish in the top three in every race of a season and then
also broke the record for most consecutive podium finishes. According to the official
Formula One website, he is "statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen".
After beginning with karting, Schumacher won German drivers' championships in Formula
König and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship.
After one Mercedes-funded race for the Jordan Formula One team, Schumacher signed as
a driver for the Benetton Formula One team in 1991. After winning consecutive championships
with Benetton in 1994/5, Schumacher moved to Ferrari in 1996 and won another five consecutive
drivers' titles with them from 2000 to 2004. Schumacher retired from Formula One driving
in 2006 staying with Ferrari as an advisor.[6] Schumacher agreed to return for Ferrari
part-way through 2009, as cover for the badly injured Felipe Massa, but was prevented
by a neck injury. Schumacher returned to Formula One on a permanent basis from 2010 with
the Mercedes team before retiring for a second time at the conclusion of the 2012 season.
